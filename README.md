# Satellite Propogation Toolkit

> **_WARNING:_** This project is still under construction

Satellite propogation toolkit is a project written in Python to propogate orbitting satellites and other debris based on radar tracking data from CelesTrak.

The focus of this project is providing information in a form that allows anyone to relate it to there current environment and to try and bring space closer to the ground. As such a large part of this project is dedicated to Topocentric analysis and visualisation.

Satellite Propogatioin Toolkit currently has the following features:

* Automatic download and caching of data from CelesTrak
* Attaching additional metadata to tracked objects using SATCAT (Satellite Catologue)
* Propogating objects using the SGP4 model
* Tracking satellites relative to geocentric (latitude and longitude) and topocentric (altitude and azimuth) reference frames
* Filtering and proccessing the satellite data
* Calculating satellite position relative to rectangular projections
* Generating images representing current satellite positions based on satellite metadata
* Displaying live satellite positions on Stellar Unicorn LED Matrix
